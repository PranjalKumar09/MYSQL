    Real Table: Can be directly modified using INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
    Virtual Table: Typically cannot be modified directly. Views can sometimes be updatable, but this depends on the complexity of the view.

    Real Table: Data is persistent and remains stored until explicitly deleted.
    Virtual Table: Exists temporarily when queried; views persist as definitions but do not store data.


    Real Table: May be faster to query because the data is already stored and indexed.
    Virtual Table: Can be slower because the data is generated dynamically, especially if the underlying query is complex.

    * However we can see the data in many ways (select)
    * If a table that is used in a view is dropped or removed from the database, the view will become invalid


To delete this -> DROP VIEW info_inst;
